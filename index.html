      <h4>Characteristics of High Quality Kitchen</h4>
      <p>High quality kitchen cabinets should look stunning and provide functional, easy-to-use storage at least twenty or thirty years. But many people have cabinet problems much sooner than this, reporting issues such as crooked doors, sagging,
        deteriorating drawers, scratched and dented faces, loose hinges, and warping boxes. These problems occur because of low-quality cabinet construction</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The face frame creates the front opening of the cabinet. It is built from horizontal pieces of lumber called stiles, connected together by horizontal linking pieces called rails.</li>
          <li>Countertop supports are commonly added to add rigidity and provide an attachment surface for the countertop.</li>

          The frame of the door is similar in appearance to a picture frame. It is made of vertical stiles, and horizontal rails. The center panel is attached to the door frame, and completes the front of the door.

          It may be made of solid wood, a wood fiber product, or glass.Some doors have a third stile, which is sometime referred to as a mullion.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some inset cabinet doors sit flush with the face of the cabinet frame; other doors are larger than the cabinet door opening, and sit on top of the frame. The amount of frame visible when the doors closed is called the reveal.

          Drawer slides are the metal slides attached to the drawer that allow it to be pulled and pushed to open and close it. Good slides are made of high quality materials that are designed to slide easily, and are also durable enough to last for
          a lifetime.
        </p>

        <p>
          A very popular current trend is to use soft-close door slides. As the door is pushed closed, the slide allows the drawer to close rapidly over most of its closing distance. As it nears the fully closed position, however, the slide applies
          a “brake” that slows the drawer, allowing it to close the last inch very slowly and softly. </p>
